●We follow conspiracy and debunking narratives about COVID-19 origination on a major Chinese social media platform, Weibo, from Jan to April 2020. Popular conspiracies about COVID-19 on Weibo, including that the virus is human-synthesized or a bioweapon, differ substantially from those in the US. 

●We use the largest Weibo post corpus to understand the prevalent conspiracy and counteractive narratives regarding COVID-19 origination, over different phases during the pandemic, from Jan 1 to April 30, 2020.
